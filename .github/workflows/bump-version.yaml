# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "bump-version"
  bump-version:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # Check out the content (source branch).  Use a deploy key so that
    # when we push changes, it will trigger the release workflow
    # run that runs on: tag. (Using the GitHub token would
    # not run the workflow to prevent infinite recursion.)
